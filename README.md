This is a repository for a personal game development project.

I've been working on this project in my free time developing a Multiplayer Arena Shooter similar to classics like Halo or Unreal Tournament. I'm doing all the development on the Unity engine and I'm using Mirror as a networking solution. Figuring out multiplayer has been a challenge, but I've lately made a lot of good progress.

Currently, the demo has a few working features:
1) Multiplayer synced weapons inventory per player
2) Multiplayer synced movement
3) Multiplayer synced health
4) Ability to damage players
5) Ability to respawn after health -> 0
6) Ability to drop a weapon (with Q).
    - Cannot yet pick the weapon back up
7) Advanced Movement!
    - Wallrunning is in the game and works
    
Todo List:
1) Fix weapon pickups
2) Make weapons drop on death and despawn after a period of time.
3) Add a start menu?
4) Finish the demo map
5) Add melee????
6) Add grenades
7) Add map weapons
    - Good arena shooters have power weapons that spawn at certain spots during certain times in the match. Make a system to manage this.
8) Add more weapons
9) Create the context of a Match
    - Matches have a score limit, keep track of kills/deaths of each player, keep track of match time (Works with map weapon spawns).
    - Concept of teams
    - Pre-match lobby?
    - Game Modes?
    - Scoreboard?
    
Long Term Todo List:
1) Literally art.
    - Need map art, weapon models, character models, animation ...
2) More maps to choose from in pre-match lobby
3) Find a better way to distribute the game than through github.

If all of this gets implemented (long road) we would be looking pretty good I think!
